/*You are given an array of integers which contains positive and negative integers, you have to rearrange this array , preserving the original order, so that positive numbers appear after negative ones. Ensure that the relative positions of elements remain unchanged. Write a program to perform this segregation without altering the sequence of positive and negative integers.
input format : integer number n
                n number of integers (which is a mix of positive and negative integers)
output format : List of integers

For example,
Example 1:
Input: 8  
9 -3 5 -2 -8 -6 1 3
Output: [-3, -2, -8, -6, 9, 5, 1, 3]
Example 2:
Input : 8
5 -4 3 -4 2 1 -5 -6
output :[-4, -4, -5, -6, 5, 3, 2, 1]

/*
You are playing a game. There are N boxes placed in a row (0-indexed), 
every box has some points. You need to play the game with the following rules:
	- Initially your score is  '0' points.
	- Suppose the box has P points in it.
	  if p>0 you will gain P points, if p<0 you will loose P points.
	- You are allowed to choose any number of consecutive boxes, atleast 1 box.
	
You are given the points in the N boxes as points[]. 
Your target is to maximize your score, and return the highest score possible. 

Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: An integer N.
Line-2: N space separated integers, points[].

Output Format:
--------------
An integer, print the highest score.

Sample Input-1:
---------------
9
-3 1 -2 4 -2 2 3 -5 4
Sample Output-1:
----------------
7
Explanation:
------------
By selecting consecutive boxes are [4,-2,2,3] has the highest score is 7

Sample Input-2:
---------------
2
1 -2
Sample Output-2:
----------------
1
Explanation:
------------
By picking the box is [1] has the highest score is 7
